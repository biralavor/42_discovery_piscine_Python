## Deployment notes
- This site is a static HTML/JS/CSS site. No Jekyll or static site generator is used.
- The main entry point is `index.html` at the root of the repository.
- All assets and study files are loaded directly by the browser.
- To deploy, simply push to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will serve the site from the root.
